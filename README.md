Anamaly detection plays an important role in predictive maintenance. Often anomalies are particularly difficult to identify. In this notebook, different models are compared
1) Isolation Forest
2) AutoEncoders: \
    a- Deep Neural Network \
    b- Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM)
3) Variational AutoEncoder: Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM)
